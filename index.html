                                    of study, Safety & Fire Engineering, to fill the large void of professionals in the HSEF
                                    (Health, Safety, Environment and Fire) field. Towards the end of 20th Century a group of
                                    Safety & Fire engineering students from CUSAT gathered for brainstorming on creating a
                                    platform for them to communicate, unite and evolve together for a SAFER WORLD. It was
                                    then, ASFE an alumni association of safety and fire protection professionals of CUSAT
                                    evolved.

                                    Engineering to help practicing engineers in and around Cochin. Research activities were
                                    started from 1981 with Ph.D. programme in Civil Engineering. Later the School introduced
                                    B.Tech programme in five major disciplines. The School functions through its Divisions:
                                    Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics, Computer Science, Safety & Fire, and
                                    Information Technology. School of Engineering has been well accepted as a Research
                                    Centre and a major Consultancy Centre. A number of research projects have been
                                    sanctioned to school by pioneering research agencies like DST, ISRO, AICTE, UGC, Coir
